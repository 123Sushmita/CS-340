Final Dashboard Code and README Submission

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs requires following best practices such as modular programming, clear documentation, meaningful variable and function names, and consistent code formatting. In Project One, I implemented a CRUD Python module, which provided a structured and reusable way to interact with the database. By keeping the database operations separate from the dashboard code, I made it easier to modify and extend the functionality. This modular approach allowed me to seamlessly integrate the CRUD operations into Project Two’s dashboard widgets without modifying the database logic. In the future, I could reuse this CRUD module in other projects that require similar database interactions, ensuring efficiency and consistency in my development process.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?

When tackling a problem, I break it down into smaller, manageable components and systematically analyze the requirements. For this project, I started by understanding Grazioso Salvare’s database and dashboard requirements. I identified key functionalities, such as data retrieval and visualization, and designed an approach that ensured efficiency and scalability. Compared to previous assignments, this project required integrating multiple components, including database interactions and a graphical user interface. I applied techniques like structured query design, error handling, and object-oriented principles to ensure a robust implementation. Moving forward, I will continue to apply these strategies to design databases that effectively meet client needs.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?

Computer scientists develop solutions that optimize processes, enhance decision-making, and improve user experiences. In this project, my work contributed to Grazioso Salvare’s ability to manage and analyze data efficiently. By designing a structured database and a user-friendly dashboard, I enabled streamlined data access and visualization. This kind of work is crucial for businesses and organizations that rely on data-driven decision-making. A well-implemented system improves operational efficiency, reduces errors, and enhances overall productivity, demonstrating the significant impact of computer science in real-world applications.
